# Slot777 — Basic

## When to use

- User invokes **Slot777** or work in **games** (phase 9 (Games add-on))
- Focused task within this agent's scope

## Agent

- **Path:** `ai-agents/games/slot777-agent.md`
- **Role:** Slot777 Agent specialist for Stream Heaven's classic 3-reel slot mini-game — paylines, scatter/bonus hooks, and responsible stake limits.

## Scope (basic)

- Load `platform-governance/MASTER-AI-OPERATING-SYSTEM.md` (or `MASTER-GOVERNANCE-PROMPT.md` for lighter sessions)
- Open agent: `ai-agents/games/slot777-agent.md` and copy its `## Prompt Template` block
- Work within assigned path boundaries; contract-first in `packages/shared-contracts/`
- Run `node scripts/validate-agents.mjs` after editing agent markdown

## Role-specific skills

### Game Loop & State Management
Design:
- Design server-side slot engine (reels, paylines, symbol weights, bonus triggers). (Slot777 scope)
- server-authoritative game state with deterministic turn order
- state snapshots for reconnect and late-join recovery
- turn timeout and forfeit handling for mobile sessions
- idle player detection and bot backfill policies
- game phase transitions (lobby → active → results)

### Realtime Sync & Socket Protocol
Implement:
- Socket.IO room channels per match with Redis pub/sub fan-out
- delta updates vs full-state sync for low-bandwidth clients
- client prediction with server reconciliation for smooth UX
- heartbeat and disconnect grace periods
- event ordering guarantees for dice rolls and moves
- Configurable RTP bands per stake tier with games-economy-agent approval.

### Matchmaking & Lobbies
Configure:
- skill-based and casual queue definitions in Redis
- private room codes and friend-invite flows
- queue wait thresholds with optional bot fill
- regional latency-aware server selection
- concurrent match capacity per game type
- Build Flutter slot UI with Lottie/spine-lite animations within cost-control budget.

### Fair Play & Anti-Cheat
Enforce:
- server-side RNG for dice, cards, and outcomes
- move validation against authoritative rules engine
- rate limits on actions and suspicious pattern detection
- audit logs for disputed matches and refunds
- replay verification for tournament disputes

### Economy & Rewards Integration
Wire:
- optional coin entry fees via wallet-service contracts
- winner payout and rake configuration
- daily reward hooks and streak bonuses
- leaderboard point accrual on match completion
- graceful handling of insufficient balance at entry

# Serverless — Basic

## When to use

- User invokes **Serverless** or work in **core-engineering** (phase 5)
- Focused task within this agent's scope

## Agent

- **Path:** `ai-agents/core-engineering/serverless-agent.md`
- **Role:** Ai Agents/Core Engineering/Serverless specialist for Stream Heaven's infrastructure domain within the four-app entertainment ecosystem.

## Scope (basic)

- Load `platform-governance/MASTER-AI-OPERATING-SYSTEM.md` (or `MASTER-GOVERNANCE-PROMPT.md` for lighter sessions)
- Open agent: `ai-agents/core-engineering/serverless-agent.md` and copy its `## Prompt Template` block
- Work within assigned path boundaries; contract-first in `packages/shared-contracts/`
- Run `node scripts/validate-agents.mjs` after editing agent markdown

## Role-specific skills

### Domain Expertise
Apply:
- Identify candidates: image resize webhooks, geo redirect, bot detection. (Serverless scope)
- deep understanding of assigned domain responsibilities
- platform-governance standards for all outputs
- contract-first design in packages/shared-contracts/
- coordination with dependent agents listed in agent file
- optimization for Indian market constraints

### Implementation Standards
Follow:
- smallest correct diff for all changes
- existing codebase conventions in apps/, services/, packages/
- no duplicate services — check services/ first
- no secrets in code — env vars and Secrets Manager only
- English in code; user strings via i18n ARB files
- Define cold start budgets compatible with live room entry flows.

### Technical Execution
Execute:
- NestJS backend patterns for service implementations
- Flutter/Riverpod patterns for mobile UI work
- PostgreSQL schema design with migration safety
- Redis caching and pub/sub where appropriate
- Socket.IO realtime integration when required
- Coordinate serverless-agent deployments with aws-architect standards.

### Quality & Validation
Validate:
- node scripts/validate-agents.mjs after agent edits
- contract validation against OpenAPI specs
- integration tests for critical paths
- low-end Android performance verification
- documentation of decisions and handoff artifacts

### Governance & Handoff
Document:
- MASTER-AI-OPERATING-SYSTEM.md as primary context
- governance references listed in agent file
- integration notes for downstream agents
- test strategy and acceptance criteria
- escalation paths for out-of-scope decisions

# Video Buffering — Basic

## When to use

- User invokes **Video Buffering** or work in **apps/livestream-app** (phase 9)
- Focused task within this agent's scope

## Agent

- **Path:** `apps/livestream-app/agents/video-systems/video-buffering-agent.md`
- **Role:** Apps/Livestream App/Agents/Video Systems/Video Buffering specialist for Stream Heaven's video-systems domain within the four-app entertainment ecosystem.

## Scope (basic)

- Load `platform-governance/MASTER-AI-OPERATING-SYSTEM.md` (or `MASTER-GOVERNANCE-PROMPT.md` for lighter sessions)
- Open agent: `apps/livestream-app/agents/video-systems/video-buffering-agent.md` and copy its `## Prompt Template` block
- Work within assigned path boundaries; contract-first in `packages/shared-contracts/`
- Run `node scripts/validate-agents.mjs` after editing agent markdown

## Role-specific skills

### Live Room Lifecycle
Own:
- Calibrate initial buffer depth vs time-to-first-frame for 2GB RAM devices. (Video Buffering scope)
- room create, start, join, leave, and end state machine
- deterministic transitions with idempotent API calls
- viewer count safety guards against race conditions
- graceful host disconnect and co-host takeover
- cross-app handoff for room discovery surfaces

### Streaming Token & Provider Integration
Integrate:
- Agora token bootstrap contract with AGORA_APP_ID env only
- no embedded provider secrets in codebase
- token TTL aligned with expected session duration
- publisher vs subscriber role token differentiation
- provider failover prep for Zego as alternate
- Implement stall recovery with exponential backoff on segment fetch failures.

### Livestream API Contracts
Define:
- /v1/livestream/* OpenAPI in packages/shared-contracts
- room list, create, start, join, leave, end endpoints
- viewer count and room metadata in responses
- api-gateway proxy with JWT X-User-Id propagation
- backward-compatible contract evolution for Phase 3 features
- Prefetch adjacent quality rungs when bandwidth headroom detected.

### Realtime Events
Emit:
- livestream.room.started event schema
- livestream.viewer.joined and viewer.left events
- livestream.room.ended with duration and peak viewer stats
- Socket.IO broadcast channels per room
- event schema ownership with socketio-architect

### Mobile Live Room UX
Guide:
- Flutter live room list in apps/mobile
- low-bandwidth preview thumbnails via CDN
- one-tap join with minimal pre-buffer
- host go-live flow optimized for low-end Android
- background audio handling for audio-room mode
